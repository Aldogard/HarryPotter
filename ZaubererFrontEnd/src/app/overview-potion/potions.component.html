        <ul>
          <li>
            Healing indicates the percentage of the initial Healthpoints, that
            is restored by using the Potion. 0 indicates that this potion cannot
            restore health. Some Potions can even decrease the health of a
            wizard.
          </li>
          <li>
            Energy indicates the percentage of the initial Energy, that is
            restored by using the Potion. 0 indicates that this potion cannot
            restore energy.
          </li>
          <li>
            Anti Paralysis indicates whether the use of the Potion protects

            Some Potions are able to inflict damage on the opposing Wizard. Max
            Damage indicates the maximum amount of damage that can be inflicted.

            Additional Factor (AF) increases the Factor of the Wizard times the
            indicated Factor when the Potion is used. 1 indicates that there is
            no increase.
