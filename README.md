# HarryPotter
My personal Harry Potter project to improve my Java and TS skills.

I am currently learning Java and Angular and I want to deepen and expand my skills by doing this little project.
Since I am a huge Harry Potter fan, I decided to create a Harry Potter battle.

At the moment, the project includes:

- Home Page
- Overview for
  - all Wizards
  - Potions
  - Spells
  - Animals
- Detailview for
  - all Wizards
  - Potions
  - Spells
  - Animals
- Set up for the Battle
- The Battle
- Possibility to create a wizard
- Possibility to update a wizard
- Search bar

Furthermore the site includes 
- overview about the rules of the battle
- possibility to delete wizards (hidden)
