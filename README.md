Personal Harry Potter project to improve my Java and TS skills.

At the moment, the project includes:

- Home Site
- Overview for
  - all wizards
  - Potions
  - Spells
  - Animals
- Detailview for
  - all wizards
  - Potions
  - Spells
  - Animals
- Set up for the Battle

- Possibility to create a wizard
- Possibility to update a wizard
- Search bar

Furthermore the site includes 
- overview about the rules of the battle
- possibility to delete wizards (hidden)
